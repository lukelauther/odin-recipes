        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            These Reuben sandwiches are really delicious and easy to make. They are one of my family's fix-it-quick favorites. 
            I like to serve them with big bowls of steaming vegetable soup and dill pickles on the side.

                Place sandwiches, butter-side down on the preheated griddle; butter the top of each sandwich with remaining butter.
